    <h1>Basic Formatting Using Inline CSS</h1>
    <center>
    <p>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTMLIn web design, using CSS to float images within paragraphs can significantly enhance the visual appeal and readability of text. By applying the float property to an image, designers can position it to the right or left, allowing the surrounding text to wrap around it seamlessly. This technique is commonly employed in articles and blogs, where images complement the written content. For instance, by setting appropriate margins, designers can ensure that the text maintains a comfortable distance from the image, preventing any cluttered appearance. Overall, this method not only improves the aesthetic quality of a webpage but also helps to engage readers by creating a more dynamic layout.</p>
